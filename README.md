## Requirements
Tested with:
* PyTorch 1.4.0

* Torchvision 0.5.0

* Python 3.6.8

## Data Preparation
* Download the  data from [DeepLabCut Mouse Pose](https://zenodo.org/record/4008504#.YQaXwpNKjDJ) and [DeepPoseKit Animal Pose](https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit-Data/tree/master/datasets). Then put them under the data directory:
	```
	-labeled-data\  
	
	  -mouse\  
           ...
	  -flyimage\ 
           ...   
	  -zebraimage\  
           ...
  ```            
## Training

* Before running `train.py`, we need to compile Directionmax operation used in our paper, which is inspired by the corner pooling scheme in [CornerNet](https://github.com/princeton-vl/CornerNet).
```
`cd <CornerNet dir>/models/py_utils/_cpools/`
`python setup.py install --user`
```
* Then train the model
```
`python train.py`
```

## Ethical Proof
All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 (UK) and approved by the Queenâ€™s University Belfast Animal.
